# M>ap is greater than advanced projections

M>ap (pronounced migtap) is a library of advanced projections and transformations for [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com), released under the GNU LGPL v3 license (see LICENSE for the full text).
In short it means this library can be freely distributed and modified even for commercial use, provided you give credit and don't blame me if anything happened at all.

## Functions
Functions at the moment are limited to projections of points on lines (both simple straight lines and multipart lines), in any number of dimensional space.
